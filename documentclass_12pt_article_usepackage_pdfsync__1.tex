Under the action of forces, the elastic rod-like filament suffers deformations, which we assume to be planar. Whenever these deformations occur, it will be a contact force \textbf{n}(s,t) exerted by the material of [s,1] on that of [0,s). \textbf{n}(s,t) is assumed to lie to the (\textbf{e_1,e_2})-plane, so that it has the form
\[  \mathbf{n}(s,t)= N(s,t) \mathbf{a}(s,t) + H(s,t)\mathbf{b} (s,t).
\]
Let \mathbf{m}(s,t) be the contact couple exerted by the material of [s,1] on tha of [0,s). We assume that \mathbf{m} is perpendicular to the (\mathbf{e_1,e_2})-plane so that it has the form
\[ 
\mathbf{m}(s,t) = M(s,t)\mathbf{e}_3.
\]

We assume that the material of the rod is viscoelastic causing internal energy dissipation and having constitutive equations of the form
\[  N (s,t)=  \hat{N}(\nu (s,t),\eta (s,t)) + \tilde{A} \nu_t (s,t)
\]
\[  H (s,t)=  \hat{H}(\nu (s,t),\eta (s,t)) + \tilde{B} \eta_t (s,t)
\]
\[  M (s,t)=  \hat{M}(\nu (s,t),\eta (s,t), \mu(s,t)) + \tilde{C} \mu_t (s,t),
\]
where \^{N},\^{H},\^{M} are given functions on (0, \infty ) \textmultiply \textcolonmonetary{R} \textmultiply \textcolonmonetary{R} and where A, B, C are positive constants.

We model this by introducing the elastic potential density  as
\[ \mathcal{U}(\mathbf{y}) = \frac{\cA}{2} (\nu - \nu_0)^2
+ \frac{\cC}{2} (\eta - \eta_0 )^2
+ \frac{\cB}{2} (\mu -\alpha)^2,
\]
where \alpha = \alpha(s,t) is the spontaneous curvature, \nu = \nu(s,t) describes the stretch, \eta = \eta(s,t) defines the shear strain and {\cA}, {\cB}, {\cC} represent respectively the the stretch stiffness, the bending stiffness and the shear stiffness,
\\
and by introducing the internal energy dissipation density as 
\[ \mathcal{D}_{diss}(\mathbf{y}_t) = \frac{\tilde{A}}{2}\mid\mu_t\mid^2 + \frac{\tilde{B}}{2}\mid\eta_t\mid^2
+ \frac{\tilde{C}}{2}\mid\nu_t\mid^2.
\]
