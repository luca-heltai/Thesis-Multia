\section{Some highlights of Hamilton's Principle}
\\
Consider a system of particles in $\mathbb{E}^3$ whose position, or \emph{configuration}, can be described by a set of independent generalized coordinates $\mathbf{q}$_{k}, k = 1, 2, . . . ,K. Let t_1 and t_2 be fixed times, with t_1 < t_2, and suppose that $\mathbf{q}$(t_1) and $\mathbf{q}$(t_2) are prescribed.\\
An \emph{admissible} motion of the system will be defined to be a set of functions $\mathbf{q}$_{k}(t), k = 1, 2, . . .,K, which satisfy the prescribed values at t_1 and t_2 and are C^2 on [t_1, t_2].\\
We translate in mathematical terms the fact that there might be different configurations by introducing a \emph{perturbation} $\delta\mathbf{q}$_k, which is an arbitrary C^2 function on [t_1,t_2] subject to the requirements that $\delta\mathbf{q}$_k(t_1)= 0 and $\delta\mathbf{q}$_k(t_2)=0.
\\
Let the admissible \emph{comparison motion} of the system be defined by 
\[ \mathbf{q}_k^{\ast}(t,\epsilon) = \mathbf{q}_k(t) + \epsilon\eta\mathbf{q}_k(t) k = 1, 2, . . .,K \]
It will be convenient to introduce the notation
\[  \delta(\cdot) = \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial\epsilon}(\cdot)^{\ast} \right]_{\epsilon=0} \]
The symbol $\delta(\dot)$ is called the variation of the expression $(\cdot)$.
\\\\
Let it be assumed that the kinetic energy of the system, $\mathcal{T}$, can be expressed as a function of the generalized coordinates and their time derivatives, $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}(\mathbf{q}_k,\cdot{\mathbf{q}}_k)$. This expression indicates that $\mathcal{T}$ may be a function of $\mathbf{q}$_k and $\dot{\mathbf{q}}$_k for each value of k from 1 to K.
If the system is subject to conservative forces, then its potential energy $\mathcal{U}$ can be expressed as a function of the generalized coordinates, $\mathcal{U}$=$\mathcal{U}$($\mathbf{q}$_k). 
\\
Each of the second partial derivatives of $\mathcal{T}$ and each of the first partial derivatives of $\mathcal{U}$ will be assumed to exist and to be continuous.
\\\\
We define the \emph{Lagrangian} of the system
\[ \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{T}-\mathcal{U}, \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}}_k).\]
\\\\
Let now the system be subjected to both conservative and nonconservative forces. We define the \emph{virtual work} associated with the \emph{nonconservative forces} $\mathcal{Q}_k$  
\[ \delta\mathcal{W}=\mathcal{Q}_k\delta\mathbf{q}_k.\]
\\
Thus far it has been assumed that the generalized coordinates $\mathbf{q}_k$ are independent. Suppose instead that they are required to satisfy prescribed equations 
\[ \alpha_p(\mathbf{q}_k)=0, \] 
where p = 1, 2, . . . , P , P < K. The first partial derivatives of the functions $\alpha$_p with respect to each of the $\mathbf{q}$_k will be assumed to exist and be continuous.
\\Let $\pi$_p(t), p = 1, 2, ..., P , denote a set of functions of time, the \emph{Lagrange multipliers} , that are assumed to be C^0 on [t1, t2], and define
\[ \mathcal{C} = \pi_p\alpha_p.\]
\\
Then the Hamilton's Principle for a constrained system of particles that involves both conservative and nonconservative forces states:
\\\\
\emph{"Among admissible motions, the actual motion of a system is such that}
\[  \int_{t_1}^{t_2} [\delta(\mathcal{T}-\mathcal{U}) + \delta\mathcal{W} + \delta\mathcal{C}] \,dt = 0."\]
