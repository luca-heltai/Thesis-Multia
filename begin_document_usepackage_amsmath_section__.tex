\section{Linearization and week formulation}

Notice that what we find are strongly nonlinear equations in almost all variables.
We linearize them by splitting all nonlinear terms by freezing either $\nu, \eta, \theta_s$ or $\theta_t$ as it is more convenient. Then for any $\bar{\nu}, \bar{\eta}, \bar{\theta}_s$ and $\bar{\theta}_t$ we can write the linear system in the independent variables $\theta, \nu, \eta$, M, N and H:

\begin{bmatrix}
    a_1\\ a_2\\ a_3
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{11} & A_{12} & A_{13}\\
A_{21} & A_{22} & A_{23}\\
A_{31} & A_{32} & A_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
