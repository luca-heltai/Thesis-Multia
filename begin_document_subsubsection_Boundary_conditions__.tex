\subsubsection{Boundary conditions in classical Beck's Problem}

We prescribe the position of the end s_1 = 0 by requiring that there be the given vector $\mathbf{r}_1$ such that
\[ \mathbf{r}(0) = \mathbf{r}_1.\]
We assume that $\mathbf{r}_1$ = $\mathbf{0}$
In this case, we do not prescribe the force $\mathbf{T}(s_1)$ acting at the end, so that it remains free to accommodate ... .
